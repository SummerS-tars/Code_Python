# Python Grammar Notes

mainly about something not similar to other basic programming languages  

## Process Control Structure

conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`  

```py
if condition1:
    # code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # code to execute if condition2 is true
else:
    # code to execute if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
```

besides  
in python  
`statement 1 if condition else statement 2`  
similar to the three-way operator in C-like languages  
`statement 1 ? statement 2 : statement 3`  

loop statements: `while`, `for`, `else`

```py
while condition:
    # code to execute repeatedly
else:
    # code to execute if the condition is false
    # won't be executed if loop is exited via break
```

`for` is the same
